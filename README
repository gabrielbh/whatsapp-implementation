REMARKS:

ANSWERS:
1)
    a. we will modify the parser and add an opcode to support the command.

    b. First we will add an opcode to support the command.
       Then when we identify the command we'll erase the name from the client's vector of group names.

2. for whatsapp like service we need reliable transformation of information, that includes indication to tell us
   if the other side received the message fully and in the right order.

3. video streaming & online gaming - UDP is less reliable than TCP but is faster.
    In these cases the speed of communications beets the accuracy.

4. After every iteration (or some iterations), we will save the data to a file.
   The file is on the hard disk so in the event of crashing the information is not lost,
   and we can restore it when the server goes back up.
